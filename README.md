# FacialTrustPay

### MVP for Micropayments with Facial Recognition in Blockchain

FacialTrustPay is an MVP designed to facilitate micropayments using facial recognition and blockchain technology. This solution ensures fast and secure transactions while prioritizing user privacy. Unlike other solutions that store biometric data, FacialTrustPay generates a unique facial hash that identifies users without storing sensitive information, such as facial images.

## How It Works
1. **Facial Recognition**: A facial recognition system converts the user's image into a unique hash. This process ensures that the original facial image is neither stored nor transmitted.
2. **Facial Hash**: The generated hash acts as a unique identifier for each user. This hash is irreversible, meaning it cannot be used to retrieve the original image.
3. **Blockchain Technology**: Transactions are managed using blockchain technology, providing security, transparency, and speed in payment processing.
4. **Privacy Guaranteed**: By not storing biometric data, the solution complies with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, which require that users' sensitive information is protected and not stored without explicit consent.

## Why It Is Disruptive
FacialTrustPay introduces a revolutionary approach to digital payments:
- **Privacy Innovation**: Unlike other systems that compromise user privacy by storing biometric data, FacialTrustPay uses a method that does not store this data. The creation of a unique, non-reversible facial hash is a breakthrough in protecting user identity.
- **Compliance with Regulations**: This solution aligns with strict privacy laws, such as GDPR, by not storing or processing sensitive personal data without user consent.
- **Application in Micropayments**: The ability to perform fast and secure micropayments using blockchain is a unique value proposition that positions FacialTrustPay as a leader in technological innovation.

## Key Features
- **Fast and Secure Micropayments**: Blockchain technology ensures transactions are efficient and secure.
- **User Privacy**: No biometric data is stored or shared. The facial hash allows identification without exposing personal information.
- **Innovative and Disruptive**: Combining facial recognition and blockchain for payments is a unique and advanced market solution.
- **Compliance with Privacy Laws**: This solution is designed to adhere to global privacy regulations, making it suitable for use in multiple jurisdictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Main framework for the application.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing to improve code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For custom styles and responsive design.
- **Headless UI**: For interactive components without default styles.
- **RainbowKit**: Wallet connection and support for multiple networks.
- **Wagmi**: Management of blockchain networks, including Binance Smart Chain Testnet.
- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet**: Pre-configured testnet for testing and development before mainnet deployment.
- **@vladmandic/human**: Library for advanced facial recognition and biometric analysis.

## Deployment
FacialTrustPay is currently deployed on the Binance Smart Chain Testnet for testing and development. The contracts are available for review and audit in the repository.
